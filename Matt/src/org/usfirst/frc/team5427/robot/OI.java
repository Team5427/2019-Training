	// by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
	// commands the same as any other Button.

	//// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
	// Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
	// three ways:

	// Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
	// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	// button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

	// Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
	// the button is released.
	// button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
	
	// Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
	// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
	// button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
